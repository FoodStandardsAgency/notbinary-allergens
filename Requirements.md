### Business requirements

We had a workshop at the beginning of Phase 2 of the Discovery to determine the business requirements from FSA's perspective. These requirements are at high level requirements that will need to be developed. They are solution agnostic.

The key outputs from this workshop are:

* What does success look like from an FSA perspective?
* Where a potential reporting solution could fit into the FSA wider ecosystem?
* How does FSA want to utilise the data that is captured?

The full business requirements can be downloaded [here](uploads/Business_Requirements_.xlsx)

### Data requirements

We also created data requirements to determine the information the FSA needs for a reporting solution. In the requirements we have also drafted local authority data requirements, though these will need to be refined in the next project phase. 

The data requirements can be downloaded [here](uploads/Data_set_that_is_required_.xlsx)

### Non-functional requirements

We also created non-functional requirements to support the functional business requirements. These requirements describe the 'how' the potential reporting solution will need to work.
