# Retrospectives

A retrospective is a ceremony held by an agile team at the end of each sprint to openly discuss what is going well and what needs improvement. It's a key activity to help the team iteratively improve their working culture.

[FunRetro](https://funretro.io/) is a great tool for disbursed teams.
