### Overview

The impact assessment tool allows us to consider all the key contributing factors that need to be explored for each option. 

The five key contributing factors were:

1. Design, build and maintenance
1. Data
1. Discoverability and awareness
1. End User Needs
1. Other considerations

(Details of each of the factors are provided below). 

Ultimately, when considered together, the team were able to conclude how well each option met the needs of: 

* Users (consumers) 
* FSA
* Local authorities

### Details of the five contributing factors

**1. Design, build and maintenance**
* What is the complexity and effort required to set up and run each option?

**2. Data**
* FSA access to data - who owns what?
* Data standardisation - opportunities and potential complexities?
* Data quality - consistency, trust worthiness, need to validate?
* Parsing data - does the data need to be shared between different government agencies?
* GDPR + data security - potential sensitivities and considerations?

**3. Discoverability and awareness**
* How easy is it for users to find the service? 
* How would the service need to be promoted?

**4. End User Needs**
* Considerations for/impact on investigation
* Who is responsible for providing outcomes to end users?
* How likely will users be able to trust each option
* Will user anonymity be maintained?
* Will the option be able to support multi-channel opportunities?
* Accessibility considerations and digital inclusion?

**5.  Other considerations**
* Cost
* FSA metrics - will it provide data on patterns and trends?
* Existing report a food problem service - how will it be impacted? How could the option leverage some of the existing service?
