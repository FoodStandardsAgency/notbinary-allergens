Crucially, the research has confirmed that **there is a desire for people living with food allergies to be able to report an allergic reaction (actual or narrowly avoided)**

There are **five** key themes that relate to this overarching finding. 

### 1. Awareness

* The profile of food allergies has increased considerably in recent years
* Despite the increased profile there is still widespread confusion and risk-taking amongst consumers, FBOs and LAs
* Most consumers are not aware that they can report allergic food reactions or who to report it to

### 2. Behaviours of organisations

* Disparate individuals and organisations are trying to fill a void that is not being met by existing legislation (or the application of it)
* Several organisations interviewed believe that the FSA should play more of a coordinating role
* Large businesses are better equipped than small businesses to deal with those living with allergies

### 3.Consumer behaviour

* Reporting is context dependent, people are most likely to report to the FBO where they ate or purchased the food
* The attitude of the FBO is a motivating factor in wanting to report if they feel they have not been taken seriously or treated rudely
* Negligence is another important motivating factor
* Severe allergic reactions are traumatic and consumers may not be able/willing to report the reaction. This should be handled by clinical processes instead

### 4. Data

* There is some data available about reported food allergy incidents e.g. NHS, Local Authorities, consumer groups. However, much of data is fragmented, incomplete and not categorised
* People generally seem willing to share personal data as part of a reporting solution

### 5. Potential reporting solution

* Consumers want to be able to report and are reporting in higher numbers than we originally thought
* Discoverability is critical - consumers need to be made aware it exists, understand when to use it, how to use it and what to expect from it
* Any reporting solution will need to lead to an outcome - knowing the outcome is very important to consumers 
* The severity of an allergic reaction impacts the physical and emotional ability to report. Severe reactions may need a dedicated clinical reporting approach.
