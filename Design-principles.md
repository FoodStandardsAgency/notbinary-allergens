1. Enable reporting in context (where and when it happens) - must be mobile first
1. Set expectations upfront, and have clear know how
1. Easy and quick while ensuring capturing good quality, useable information
1. Mitigate against false reporting through design
1. Give genuine value
1. Be fair to all parties (representation, workloads, transparency etc)
1. Be transparent
1. Make outcomes clear and incorporate them into the reporting where possible
1. Use automation (backend and UI) to reduce workloads and communicate outcomes, give guidance and improve awareness
1. Improve awareness through education
1. Tackle semantics - connotations of ‘reporting’
1. Don’t only focus on future formal prevention (policy, guidance, council investigations) - focus on providing in-tool-experience = guidance for informal prevention (self educating) 
1. Ensure a good user experience for all parties (FSA, LAs) not just for those reporting
