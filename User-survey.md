A key part of our user research was the creation of a user survey. 

The objective of the online user survey was to get ask a representative sample of people living with food allergies (or people who cared for people living with them) about a series of key areas, including:
 
* Their attitude towards/motivations about reporting
* Understanding behaviours from past reporting
* Understanding user awareness re. ability to report
* Attitudes to reporting reactions from different food types
* Their feelings about sharing personal data

In total, there were 549 responses - higher than anticipated, particularly given that the survey was conducted over the Xmas and New Year period. 

There was a good balance of respondents from people living with food allergies and parents of children with food allergies residing in the UK. There was a good mix of age ranges, with the vast majority of respondents having a diagnosed food allergy. 

The full survey results are presented in the Findings section.
