## Problem statement

A number of problems have been acknowledged relating to the reporting of food allergies in the UK, including:
- Allergic reactions to food are currently under reported
- It is difficult to report allergic reactions
- There is no uniform method of reporting allergic incidents - reporting methods vary widely.

Collectively, these problems are potentially creating **avoidable risk** to allergic consumers

## Goals

- Who are the users?
- What is their current experience?
- What are the pain points?
- What are their user needs, including assisted digital and accessibility?
- What would motivate people to report an allergic reaction?
- How would they learn about a potential reporting service?
- How would the FSA and others potentially benefit? 
- Are there similar services we could learn from/reuse design patterns?
- How policy may impact effective service delivery?
- What is the current technology landscape?

## Our hypothesis

There is a user need for a reporting service for UK consumers who have experienced, or may potentially experience, an allergic reaction to food.
