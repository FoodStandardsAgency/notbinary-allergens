The document (attached) contains the full analysis from the online user survey.

Although the total, final number of respondents was 549, the analysis presented here was taken from 427 respondents. This was owing to a need to complete the analysis prior to the final survey cut-off date. 

The additional responses were subsequently analysed and it was agreed that there were no significant variations from the initial 427 respondents analysed to justify a second iteration.
