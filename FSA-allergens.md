# Report an allergic reaction to food

## Welcome!

This wiki contains documentation describing a potential reporting service for people who have experienced, or may potentially experience, an allergic reaction to food. It is intended to be a place where the squad (team) can keep track of progress and document their findings from the discovery, and extend into the full lifecycle of the service if it progresses to Alpha (and beyond). It is also intended to be a 'homepage' where the squad can signpost to data and information that exists elsewhere.
