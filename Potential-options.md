Following the research and analysis undertaken for Phase One, the team concluded that there are eight viable ideas worth serious consideration for the FSA.

Ideas 1-4 involve an FSA-owned reporting tool, whilst ideas 5-8 involve obtaining data from other methods.

Note - these ideas are not necessarily mutually exclusive i.e. FSA may decide to adopt two or more options to get the data it requires and provide a reporting tool for users.

**(Creation of a new, FSA-owned online reporting tool)**

* **Option 1** - there is no triaging or investigation following the submission of a report. The data is used solely for the FSA purposes.

* **Option 2**- no triaging, but individual case data is forwarded to the relevant local authority. The local authority will be responsible for investigating individual cases.   

* **Option 3** - the FSA's existing Incident and Resilience Unit (IRU) triages all individual reports. Where relevant, cases will be forwarded to the corresponding local authority to investigate. The IRU will maintain overall responsibility for managing and co-ordinating each case. The new reporting tool will need to operate (align) within the IRU's current incident process. There may be the possibility of automating some of the triage process. 

* **Option 4** - Similar to Idea 3, but with the creation of a new 'team' within the FSA instead of the IRU taking responsibility. 

**(Other ideas)**

* **Option 5** - FBOs share incident data relating to allergic reactions to food (reported to them by customers) with the FSA. There will no subsequent FSA triaging or investigation associated with this data.  

* **Option 6** - Local authorities share incident data relating to allergic reactions to food (reported to them by members of the public) with the FSA based on their current processes and capabilities. Responsibility for following up on individual cases will remain with the LA. There will no subsequent FSA triaging or investigation associated with this data.

* **Option 7** - Develop a clinical reporting process with the NHS to share patient data relating to allergic reactions to food with the FSA. Any subsequent investigation and/or follow ups will need to be determined as the option is developed.  

* **Option 8** - Conducting regular, targeted user surveys to obtain information in support of FSA policy formation. This could be on a planned and/or adhoc basis. Frequency to be determined. This will be data gathering exercise only.
